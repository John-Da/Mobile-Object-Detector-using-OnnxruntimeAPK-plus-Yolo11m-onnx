# DetectTO


DetectTO – A simple Android object detection app that lets users select a folder of `.onnx` models, choose one, and run detection on images. Results are saved in `Gallery/DetectTO`.

## Limitations

- This app has only been **tested with `YOLOv11m.onnx`**.  
- Other ONNX models may **not work correctly**.  
- Performance may vary depending on device hardware and model size.  
- This app is intended as a **demo/testing tool**, not a production-ready solution.
- Custom Labels is **not tested yet.**

> [!Warning]
> APK is provided for testing purposes. Use at your own risk. Check out in [Source Code/apks](https://github.com/John-Da/DetectTO/tree/main/source_codes/apks)

## How to use
- Download the apk from [Source Code/apks](https://github.com/John-Da/DetectTO/tree/main/source_codes/apks)
- If your device prevents unknown app installation, allow it. ( You can turn it off anytime ).
- Create folder in your storage and put your `model.onnx` files in it.
- Open the app and select the folder that you created. and
- BOOOM! Good to go!
- Select Model -> Select Image from Gallery/ Take a photo -> Confirm -> View/Save Results !
  
♦️ => You can change IOU, Label Size and Image W/H is based on the Onnx model that you exported with. <=

> [!Tip]
> - If you wish to use YOLO with ONNX, export the model as default for this demo project:
>
> ```python
> from ultralytics import YOLO
> 
> # Load a model
> model = YOLO("yolo11m.pt")        # Load an official model
> # or
> model = YOLO("path/to/best.pt")   # Load a custom trained model
> 
> # Export the model to ONNX
> model.export(format="onnx")
> ```
